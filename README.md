# Markov_CW_chain

A repository for visualizing Markov CW chains on a torus. 

## Background

Markov CW chains are stochastic processes defined on CW complexes. They are
analogous to Langevin processes on manifolds, and contain a great deal of
information about the underlying space, especially in their long-time dynamics.
They were first rigorously introduced [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.07995),
described from a statistical mechanics perspective
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00336) and
[here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00334), and illustrated
[here](https://mathusersguides.com/enchiridion-vol-2-2016-mike-catanzaro/).

## Visualizations

The above references contain various figures that might be helpful for
understanding these random processes. In addition, I have included a python
script for generating processes on a torus. The output is given in
`torus_walk_slider.html`. An interactive version can be found here:
